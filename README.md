# Finals-Lab-Task-3

This portfolio focuses on learning MySQL by creating and managing a product database. It covers basic tasks such as creating tables, adding constraints, inserting data correctly, and modifying fields. The aim is to understand how to build and structure a database using simple SQL commands.

## Step by Step Process

1. **Products Table**:  
- `id`: INT, auto-increment, primary key.  
- `product_name`: VARCHAR (100 characters), not null.  
- `price`: DECIMAL, not null.  

2. **Add Constraint**:  
- Add a `CHECK` constraint on `price` to ensure it is greater than 0.  

3. **Insert Products**:  
- Insert the following valid products:  
  - Laptop – 999.99  
  - Smartphone – 599.99  
  - Tablet – 299.99  
  - Keyboard – 19.99  
  - Mouse – 14.99  
  - Desk Lamp – 24.99  
  - Speakers – 9.99  
- Skip products with negative prices.  

4. **Update Table**:  
- Modify the `product_name` field to allow up to 120 characters.
